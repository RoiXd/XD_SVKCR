""" -- Super Vectors classes and functions --
    :::-----------------------------------:::
    Super Vectors have the same capabilities than regular vectors, but what makes them super, is that they never point at the same direction.
        In addition of the ordinary elements of a vector, Super Vectors have a third proprety: Magic!
        Magic is the seed of how will the SVector move everytime we call it .
        SVectors2 just contain 2 SVectors instead of 1 and have more features too
        BlackBoxes are a new crypto key securing, so secure that I would risklessly say that I'd give 1,000$ to the one who gets, without cheating, a succes Value from calling it

class SVector:
    """This is a SVector, a Vector that can perform magic.
        * IMPORTANT: SVectors are only called like a function (with ()) do NOT use them as a variable.

        PARAMETERS
        ----------
        d : the initial value of the vector.
        magic : the "seed" that changes the initial position of the vector each time it's used.

        
        METHODS
        -------
        translate(n) : moves the vector along its only axis(d) by n, works for negative values.
        SVector.refresh(svect) : refreshes svect by placing its value d randomly.

        
        PROPRETIES
        ----------
            magic : the seed of the svector, no getting and if you try to change its value, its reset automatically to 0.
            d : the position of the vector, changes each time you set it, can equal infinity.

            
        STR FORMATING
        -------------
            Format specs:
                * bin : returns its binary value
                * pos : returns the float of its value up to 5 decimal places
                * sig : returns the sigmoid of its value
                * mem : shows its allocation in memory (48 bits)  
        RANDOMIZATION
        -------------
            The program uses the random module, which - as its documentation says - uses SHA256 which is totally random
